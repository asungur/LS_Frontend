// Write a program to determine a student’s grade based on the average of three scores you get from the user. Use these rules to compute the grade:

// If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the grade is 'A'
// If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 90 then the grade is 'B'
// If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 70 then the grade is 'C'
// If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'
// You may assume that all input values are valid positive integers.

var score1 = Number(rlSync.question('Enter score 1:'));
var score2 = Number(rlSync.question('Enter score 2:'));
var score3 = Number(rlSync.question('Enter score 3:'));

var average = total / 3;
